The following are some things I would be interested in knowing about for any software dev workplace Iâ€™m a part of.

1. Walk me through a tech stack you use for a product that you're working on.
2. Describe the amount and types of meetings you have in a typical week.
3. What is the expectation on the hours a typical junior employee work a week?
4. If remote, describe the remote/hybrid policy.
5. What would you say is the most fulfilling engineering problem you've worked on here, or what about the greatest engineering challenge to solve?
6. How do you train/ramp up engineers who are new to the team?

(The following questions are for more senior engineers)

1. _What is something you wish were different about your
      job?/company? Any growing pains (softball answer: location, its far away
      or snowy)_
2. _What is unique about working at this company that you have not experienced elsewhere?_

(These questions are for a startup or more boutique operation)

1. As a late stage startup. How does the company decide on what to work on next? Or are you involved in any way in how that process looks like? (more for early stage startups without product market fit)
